# gloom

This is one of my old games that I have only recently found. This is actually the game that ended up landing me my first professional programming job. I believe this was originally intended to be closed source, but now that I am putting it up here, I am relicensing it under ONLY the GPL2 license.
A lot of the art was drawn for me by my friend, Matt Gobbi.
The music was composed and performed for me by my friend, Chris Ferrin.
