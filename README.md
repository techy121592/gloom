# The Gloom

This is one of my old games that I have only recently found. This is actually the game that ended up landing me my first professional programming job. I believe this was originally intended to be closed source, but now that I am putting it up here, I am relicensing the code under **ONLY** the GPL2 license. All of the rights for the art(both visual and musical) belong to the original artists(Matt and Chris.)

A lot of the art was drawn for me by my friend, Matt Gobbi.

The music was composed and performed for me by my friend, Chris Ferrin.

I fully thank them both for having faith in me and making these pieces of art. I cannot fully express the amount of graditude I feel towards them and how sorry I am that it fell by the wayside after getting a job.
